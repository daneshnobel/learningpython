#learning python by Joe Marini 

The course is available in LinkedIn Learning.
This repository has the code examples that I have practiced along the course to get the better view and understanding of the concepts.

Most of the code is self-explanatory and I have also provided comments in some parts of the exercise.But If you need explanation, please feel free to drop message, so that I can review or add more information in the code examples.

Thanks and Happy Coding!
